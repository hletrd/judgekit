## Adding a New Language

1. Add to `Language` union in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add config in `src/lib/judge/languages.ts` (toolchain version, Docker image info, compile/run commands)
3. Add Rust enum variant in `judge-worker-rs/src/types.rs`
4. Add Rust config + match arm + test entry in `judge-worker-rs/src/languages.rs`
5. Create `docker/Dockerfile.judge-<name>`
6. Add A+B test solution in `tests/e2e/all-languages-judge.spec.ts`
7. Run `npm run languages:sync` to sync to database

After syncing, the judge worker reads `dockerImage`, `compileCommand`, and `runCommand` from the database at runtime — not from compiled-in defaults. Language settings can be overridden via the admin UI at `/dashboard/admin/languages` without redeploying the worker.

## Problem Descriptions (MANDATORY)

See `.context/development/problem-descriptions.md` for full specification.

## Problem Types & Judging

Each problem has a `problemType` that selects how it is judged:

- **`auto`** — standard stdin/stdout judging. The student's full program is run
  against each test case's `input` and its stdout is compared to
  `expectedOutput` using the comparator (`exact` or `float` per
  `comparisonMode`).
- **`manual`** — judged outside the automatic pipeline (operator/manual grade).
- **`function`** — **function-signature judging**. The author defines a function
  signature (`functionSpec`) + typed I/O; the student implements only the
  function. At judge-claim time the app assembles
  `prelude + studentCode + generatedMain` into a stdin/stdout unit and sends it
  to the **unchanged** Rust worker, so it is judged like an `auto` problem.
  Implemented under `src/lib/judge/function-judging/` (types, serialization,
  per-language harness adapters, assembly). v1 supports the scalar types `int`,
  `long`, `double`, `bool`, `string` and their 1-D arrays, across 7 languages
  (`python`, `cpp23`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `java`, `go`, `csharp`).
  Non-void return only; non-double returns compare exact/order-sensitive, while
  `double`/`double[]` returns are forced to float comparison server-side
  (`resolveComparisonMode`, default tolerance `1e-9`) and emitted as
  whitespace-separated numeric tokens; no nested/map/`ListNode`/`TreeNode` types
  yet. Expected outputs are either hand-entered (serialized) or
  computed from an author-only reference solution via
  `POST /api/v1/problems/:id/compute-expected`. See `docs/api.md` →
  "Function-Signature Problems".

## Admin Language Management

`/dashboard/admin/languages` lets admins view and override per-language settings stored in the DB:
- Docker image name (`dockerImage`)
- Compile command (`compileCommand`)
- Run command (`runCommand`)
- Toggle languages enabled/disabled
- **Disk usage** — a progress bar shows total Docker disk usage on the host with color coding (green/yellow/red). Displayed at the top of the page, fetched live via the Docker images API.
- **Per-image sizes** — each language row shows the local image size fetched live from `GET /api/v1/admin/docker/images`. Rows where the image is not yet pulled show "Not built".

Changes take effect immediately for new submissions without restarting services.

## Docker Image Management API

- `GET /api/v1/admin/docker/images` — returns the list of locally available Docker images on the judge host, including per-image size in bytes. Used by the language management UI to show image availability status and sizes.
- `POST /api/v1/admin/docker/images/build` — builds a Docker image from its Dockerfile in `docker/`. Body: `{ language: string }`. Looks up the language config to derive the Dockerfile path. Admin/super_admin only. Audit logged.
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/docker/images` — removes a Docker image by tag. Body: `{ imageTag: string }`. Admin/super_admin only. Audit logged.

The language admin UI at `/dashboard/admin/languages` includes per-language Build (hammer icon) and Remove (trash icon) buttons. Image availability is shown as a badge ("Available" / "Not built") per row, with live image size fetched from the API.

**CSRF**: Mutation API routes require the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header. This is the correct header name — do not use `x-csrf-token`. The admin language management UI and E2E fetch helpers must include this header on POST/DELETE/PATCH requests.

## Student Detail Page

`/dashboard/contests/[assignmentId]/students/[userId]` — accessible to admins and instructors. Shows a per-student submission breakdown for a specific assignment, with per-problem status and submission history drill-down.

## Contest System

JudgeKit supports full contest management with two scoring models and two scheduling modes:

### Scoring Models
- **IOI** (`ioi`) — partial scoring; each problem scored independently, best score per problem counts
- **ICPC** (`icpc`) — binary scoring; problems are either accepted or not, ties broken by penalty time

### Scheduling Modes
- **Scheduled** (`scheduled`) — fixed start and end times set by the admin
- **Windowed** (`windowed`) — each participant gets a fixed-duration window starting from when they begin

### Contest Features
- **Leaderboard** with real-time rankings and optional freeze period before contest end
- **Anti-cheat** — event recording (tab switches, copy/paste, focus loss), filtering, code similarity detection
- **Participant audit** — per-participant timeline of anti-cheat events, accessible to admins/instructors
- **Contest analytics** — score distribution stats (mean, median, submitted count, perfect-score count)

## Architecture

### Database
- **PostgreSQL 18** runtime (`docker-compose.production.yml` pins `postgres:18-alpine`)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL runtime schema (`schema.pg.ts`); legacy SQLite/MySQL schema artifacts remain in-repo for migration/test context
- **Migrations**: PostgreSQL runtime migrations under `drizzle/pg/`; older SQLite/MySQL migration artifacts remain in-repo for migration/test context
- **Sync**: `npm run languages:sync` syncs language definitions from TypeScript config to the `language_configs` table
- **Relational-query `where` rewrite footgun**: `db.query.<table>.findMany({ where, … })` routes its `where` clause through `mapColumnsInSQLToAlias`, which rewrites every `${otherTable.col}` reference inside a `sql\`...\`` template to use the outer table's alias. EXISTS / IN subqueries that reference foreign tables silently emit invalid SQL (e.g. `${tags.name}` becomes `"problems"."name"`), so `db.select().from(problems).where(…)` works on the count path while the relational `findMany` 500s. Pre-resolve the foreign-table predicate to an ID list and switch to `inArray(<thisTable>.id, ids)` — single-column predicates survive the alias rewrite. See commit `5907931c` (`fix(public): unbreak tag filter on practice and problem-sets lists`).

### Security Sandbox
- **Seccomp profile**: Uses a **default-deny allow-list** approach — default action is `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO`, with required runtime syscalls explicitly allowed and targeted compatibility blocks (for example `clone3`) returning errno. This keeps container execution constrained while avoiding hard crashes in runtimes that probe unsupported syscalls.
- **Docker isolation**: No network access, memory/CPU limits, non-root user, resource timeouts
- **`JUDGE_DISABLE_CUSTOM_SECCOMP=1`**: Env var to fall back to Docker default seccomp on hosts where the custom profile is rejected

### Docker Deployment Architecture
- **Server-side builds**: `deploy-docker.sh` rsyncs source to the remote server and builds Docker images there. No local image builds — avoids architecture mismatches between dev machines (e.g., arm64 Mac) and the target host (e.g., amd64 Linux).
- **`--no-cache` on app and worker builds**: `deploy-docker.sh` passes `--no-cache` when building `judgekit-app` and `judgekit-judge-worker` to ensure a clean build on every deploy. Language images are not rebuilt with `--no-cache` by default.
- **DNS in Dockerfiles**: Languages that need network access during build (e.g., `cargo install`) set DNS explicitly in their Dockerfiles via `resolv.conf` override. The `--dns` flag is not used because it is incompatible with Docker BuildKit/buildx.
- **Architecture auto-detection**: The deploy script runs `uname -m` on the remote host and sets `--platform linux/amd64` or `--platform linux/arm64` accordingly. All `docker build` commands (app, judge worker, and all language images) receive this flag.
- **Docker socket proxy**: The deployment uses a dedicated `docker-proxy` service as the only container with direct `/var/run/docker.sock` access. The **judge worker only** talks to Docker through `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-proxy:2375`; the Next.js app calls the worker’s authenticated internal API for Docker image management instead of talking to the daemon directly.
- **Judge worker Docker access**: The worker reaches Docker through `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-proxy:2375` rather than a direct socket mount or `privileged: true`. This keeps Docker control on the proxy/host boundary while still allowing the worker to launch sibling judge containers.
- **`/judge-workspaces` volume mount** — `/judge-workspaces:/judge-workspaces` is mounted on the worker container. The `TMPDIR=/judge-workspaces` env var ensures the worker writes temporary files to this shared volume. The host must have `/judge-workspaces` created before starting the stack.
- **Compiled output path**: All compiled language Dockerfiles output binaries to `/workspace/solution` (not `/tmp/solution`). `/tmp` is an ephemeral per-container tmpfs; `/workspace` is the shared workspace bind-mounted between the worker and sibling judge containers.
- **Groovy uses Java 21**: The `judge-groovy` image is based on `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-jammy`. Groovy 4.0 requires Java 21 — Java 25 class file versions are incompatible with the Groovy bytecode verifier.
- **PID limits**: Judge containers use `--pids-limit 64` for run phase and `--pids-limit 128` for compile phase (increased from 16/64) — required for VM-based runtimes (BEAM, JVM, PowerShell) that spawn many OS threads.
- **DNS**: Judge containers use Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1). `/etc/resolv.conf` is locked with `chattr +i` to prevent container overrides.
- **Claim endpoint sh -c wrapping**: The judge claim API endpoint wraps `compileCommand` and `runCommand` values in `["sh", "-c", cmd]` before passing to the worker. The DB stores raw commands without `sh -c` — do not double-wrap when editing via admin UI.
- **Zig compile flag**: Zig 0.13 uses `-femit-bin=/workspace/solution` (not `-o`) to specify the output binary path. Example: `zig build-exe --cache-dir /tmp/zig-cache -femit-bin=/workspace/solution /workspace/solution.zig`.

### ARM64 Support

All 102 Docker images build and run on arm64 (Ampere Altra). Previously problematic images have been fixed:
- **powershell**: Now uses Microsoft's arm64 packages
- **apl**: Builds with SIMD disabled (`PERFORMANCE_WANTED=no`)
- **b**: Uses bext-lang/b compiler on arm64 (BCause on amd64) with `-hist` flag for traditional B escape sequences

### AI Assistant (chat-widget plugin)

The in-app AI coding assistant is the **`chat-widget` plugin**
(`src/lib/plugins/chat-widget/`). Four LLM providers:
`openai`, `claude`, `gemini`, `openrouter` (OpenRouter is OpenAI-wire-compatible;
base `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` + attribution headers).
Provider/model/API key are set per provider on the plugin admin page
(`/dashboard/admin/plugins/chat-widget`, `system.plugins` capability).

- **Gating**: `aiAssistantEnabled` system setting (Settings → General); forced
  **off** by default in exam/contest/recruiting modes unless
  `allowAiAssistantInRestrictedModes` is set. Also a per-problem
  `problems.allowAiAssistant` toggle. Logic in `src/lib/system-settings.ts`
  (`isAiAssistantEnabled` / `getEffectiveModeRestrictions`).
- **Live model pickers** (OpenRouter + Gemini) back the model field via
  admin-gated endpoints `GET /api/v1/plugins/chat-widget/openrouter-models`
  (proxies OpenRouter `/api/v1/models`) and
  `GET /api/v1/plugins/chat-widget/gemini-models` (proxies Google `/v1beta/models`,
  key via `x-goog-api-key`). Both cache ~1h and degrade to a hardcoded recommended
  shortlist (`openrouter-models.ts` / `gemini-models.ts`). OpenAI/Claude use a
  text model field. `test-connection` reads the saved key (never from the body).
- **Plaintext provider keys**: `openaiApiKey`/`claudeApiKey`/`geminiApiKey`/
  `openrouterApiKey` are stored **plaintext at rest** — a deliberate decision
  (`src/lib/plugins/secrets.ts` module header). Do NOT re-add encrypt-on-write.
  Response redaction and `[REDACTED]` audit logs are retained; legacy `enc:v1:`
  rows still decrypt on read. This applies ONLY to chat-widget keys —
  system-settings secrets (`hcaptchaSecret`, `smtpPass`) stay encrypted. See
  `docs/ai-assistant.md` and `docs/threat-model.md` §8.7.

### Warm Container Pool

Admin-configurable pool of pre-started, single-use judge containers kept warm per
language, so the RUN phase skips Docker cold start. Config in
`system_settings.warm_pool` (JSONB), normalized server-side to per-docker-image
targets (`resolveWarmPoolTargets` in `src/lib/judge/warm-pool.ts`; C and C++ share
`judge-cpp:latest`, counts merge with MAX). Targets reach workers via the
`register`/`heartbeat` responses (~30s to take effect). Compile stays cold;
anything the warm path can't safely serve falls back to a cold `docker run`.

- **Prerequisite**: the docker-socket-proxy must allow `exec` (**`EXEC=1`**) or
  every warm attempt silently 403s and falls back to cold. Both
  `docker-compose.production.yml` and `docker-compose.worker.yml` set it.
- **`WORKER_WARM_POOL_DISABLE=true`** (worker env): kill switch — ignore pool
  targets, judge every case cold.
- **`WARM_POOL_DEFAULT_ENABLED`** (app env, read by the Next.js app process):
  default the pool **on** for a deployment until an admin saves an explicit value;
  backfilled into `.env.production` for `DEPLOY_TARGET=oj`/`auraedu`.
- Deep doc: `docs/judge-workers.md` → "Warm container pool".

## Setup

### `scripts/setup.sh` — Interactive Setup Wizard

Run `bash scripts/setup.sh` for guided initial setup. The wizard handles:
1. Admin credential configuration (`ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars, defaults: `admin` / `admin123`)
2. Language preset selection (`core`, `popular`, `extended`, `all`, `none`)
3. Individual language add/remove
4. `npm install`, `db:push`, seed, `languages:sync`, and Docker image builds

Non-interactive mode: `bash scripts/setup.sh --defaults` (uses admin/admin123, no Docker images).

The seed script (`scripts/seed.ts`) reads `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from environment variables. If not set, defaults to `admin` / `admin123`. Credentials are written to `data/.admin-password` for reference.

## Deployment

### `deploy-docker.sh` Workflow (Primary)

The recommended deployment method. Workflow:

1. **Pre-flight**: Tests SSH, verifies remote Docker, detects remote architecture
2. **Generate `.env.production`**: Creates with fresh secrets if not present
3. **rsync source to remote**: Syncs entire repo excluding `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.git/`, `data/`, `.env*`, `*.db`, `judge-worker-rs/target/`, `rate-limiter-rs/target/`, `.omc/`, `.claude/`, `tests/`, `.playwright/`, `backups/`, `._*`
4. **Build images on remote**: Builds `judgekit-app` and, when the target includes a local worker, `judgekit-judge-worker` with `--platform` flag, then builds judge language images unless skipped
5. **Stop old containers, start new**: Uses `docker-compose.production.yml`
6. **Run database migrations**: Executes Drizzle SQL migrations inside the app container via a Node one-liner
7. **Configure nginx**: Writes config to `/tmp`, transfers via `scp`, then `sudo cp` into `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` (avoids heredoc + sudo + tee issues)
8. **Verify**: Checks HTTP response from the app container

Usage:
```bash
# Full deployment (password auth)
SSH_PASSWORD='...' REMOTE_HOST=... REMOTE_USER=... ./deploy-docker.sh

# Full deployment (key auth)
SSH_KEY=key.pem REMOTE_HOST=... REMOTE_USER=... DOMAIN=... ./deploy-docker.sh

# Skip image build (reuse existing)
./deploy-docker.sh --skip-build

# Skip judge language images only
./deploy-docker.sh --skip-languages

# Build only core language images (cpp, python, jvm)
./deploy-docker.sh --languages=core

# Build specific languages
./deploy-docker.sh --languages=cpp,python,node,rust
```

Language presets: `core` (~1.2 GB), `popular` (~4 GB), `extended` (~12 GB), `all` (~30 GB), `none`. (Sizes are empirical figures from `deploy-docker.sh --help`; reconcile any drift there first.)

### Database migration recovery (`DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE`)

The deploy script uses `drizzle-kit push` (schema-vs-DB diff) for migrations. When push detects a destructive change (e.g., `DROP COLUMN`), it prompts interactively. In a non-interactive deploy shell the prompt is unanswered and the destructive change is NOT applied. The script captures push output, scans for the data-loss prompt markers, and **aborts the deploy via `die`** so the operator must explicitly opt in via `DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE=1`. It does NOT warn-and-continue.

When this happens you will see the deploy abort with:
```
[FATAL] drizzle-kit push detected a destructive schema change but did NOT apply it ...
```

Recovery options:
1. **`DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE=1`** — re-run the deploy with this env var set. The script passes `--force` to `drizzle-kit push`, which auto-applies destructive changes. **The Step 5b psql backfill (e.g., the `secret_token_hash` backfill in `0020_drop_judge_workers_secret_token.sql`) runs on every deploy regardless of this flag**, so push --force will not orphan judge workers. Always review the diff in the deploy log first.
2. **Switch to `drizzle-kit migrate`** — change the `npx drizzle-kit push` line in `deploy-docker.sh` to `npx drizzle-kit migrate` for that one deploy. The journal SQL files (`drizzle/pg/<NN>_*.sql`) are then executed in order, including any safety backfills they embed. Verify `drizzle/pg/meta/_journal.json` and `meta/<NN>_snapshot.json` are in sync with `src/lib/db/schema.pg.ts` before doing this.

**When NOT to use `DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE=1`:** if the journal contains a destructive SQL with embedded ad-hoc cleanup code that is NOT replicated as a Step 5b psql pre-step in `deploy-docker.sh`, push --force will skip it. Add a Step 5b pre-step before relying on the force flag.

#### Sunset criteria (when Step 5b can be removed)

The Step 5b psql backfill in `deploy-docker.sh` runs unconditionally on every deploy, adding ~5-10s per deploy. It is correct (the `IF EXISTS` guard makes the DO-block a no-op when the `secret_token` column is absent), but it is intended as a transitional safety net, not a permanent fixture.

The backfill can be REMOVED when BOTH conditions hold:

1. The `secret_token` column is verified ABSENT from **all** deploy environments. Verification command (run against each environment's DB):
   ```
   psql ... -c "\d judge_workers" | grep -c secret_token
   ```
   The grep count must be `1` (only `secret_token_hash`, NOT the original `secret_token`). A count of `2` means the column still exists in that environment and Step 5b is still load-bearing there.
2. At least 6 months have passed since the cycle-6 fix was deployed (commit `18d93273` on 2026-04-26).

**Target re-evaluation date:** 2026-10-26.

When both conditions hold, delete the Step 5b block from `deploy-docker.sh` (the `# Step 5b: Pre-drop secret_token backfill` block, near line 941) AND this subsection from `AGENTS.md`. Cross-reference: `.context/reviews/_aggregate.md` AGG7-1 (cycle-7 plan).

### SSH Authentication

The script supports two methods:
- **Password auth**: Set `SSH_PASSWORD` env var (requires `sshpass` installed locally)
- **Key auth**: Set `SSH_KEY` to the path of the private key file

### nginx Configuration

The deploy script writes the nginx config to a local temp file, transfers it to the remote host via `scp`, then uses `sudo cp` to install it. This avoids the common pitfall of heredoc + sudo + tee over SSH. The config includes rate limiting for auth and judge endpoints.

### `deploy.sh` (Legacy Systemd Deploy)

For hosts running services directly via systemd (not Docker). Pulls latest code, runs `npm ci`, `npm run languages:sync`, `npm run db:push`, `npm run build`, optionally builds the Rust worker with `cargo build --release`, then restarts systemd services.

### Deploy hardening

The Docker deploy script (`deploy-docker.sh`) applies several hardening measures introduced over the cycle-1/2/3/4/5 review-plan-fix cycles. They are all defense-in-depth and additive — never remove them without an explicit follow-up review:

- **`.env.production` is chmod 0600** (cycle 2, commit `ab31a40f`). Both the fresh-generation path and the existing-file defense-in-depth path apply the mode. Rationale: `umask 0022` would otherwise leave the auto-generated secrets file world-readable on the deploy host. Per `CLAUDE.md` "Secrets & Credentials": writing secrets to unencrypted files is disallowed. **Cycle 2 (commit `40250e63`) extended this to ALL `.env*` files** (`.env`, `.env.deploy*`, `.env.worv`) at 0600 and added a production startup guard `assertLoadedEnvFilePermissions` (`src/lib/security/env.ts`) that refuses to boot when the loaded env file has group/other bits set, with a `chmod 600` remediation hint. The guard is a no-op outside production and when env is injected via the process environment.
- **SSH connection multiplexing** (cycle 2, commits `21125372` + `66146861`). `deploy-docker.sh` adds `ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60 -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 -o ConnectTimeout=15` to amortize the sshpass auth handshake across rapid-fire short-lived sessions (sshd `MaxStartups` / fail2ban / PAM throttling can otherwise reject correct credentials). The control socket dir is `mktemp -d /tmp/judgekit-ssh.XXXXXX` (NOT `$TMPDIR` — macOS sets that to a long `/var/folders/...` path which combined with the 40-char `%C` hash exceeds the 104-byte Unix-domain socket path limit and breaks every SSH attempt). Cycle 4 added a defense-in-depth `chmod 700` after `mktemp -d` (commit `f5ac57ff`); the explicit chmod guards against an unset/loosened umask, even though `mktemp -d` already creates the dir 0700.
- **`_initial_ssh_check` retry** (cycle 2, commit `21125372`). 4 attempts with exponential backoff 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 s. Catches transient sshd overload at deploy start. Trap on `EXIT` runs `_cleanup_ssh_master` to tear down the control socket. Cycle 4 added a `info "SSH connection succeeded after ${attempt} attempts"` log line when retry was needed (commit `5cae08af`); silent on the happy path.
- **Destructive drizzle-kit push escalation policy** (cycle 1, codified per `### Database migration recovery (DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE)` above). Never auto-force; halt and escalate to the operator who must authorize via the explicit `DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE=1` env var with quoted-text consent. The orchestrator is forbidden from setting this preemptively.
- **`SKIP_*` env vars are honored** (cycle 1, commit `bdfc79e1`). `SKIP_BUILD`, `SKIP_LANGUAGES`, `BUILD_WORKER_IMAGE`, `INCLUDE_WORKER`, `LANGUAGE_FILTER`, `SKIP_PREDEPLOY_BACKUP`, `SKIP_POST_DEPLOY_PRUNE` all gate optional steps. (The former app-server target, `algo.xylolabs.com`, required `SKIP_LANGUAGES=true BUILD_WORKER_IMAGE=false INCLUDE_WORKER=false`; that target was retired on 2026-07-23.) Cycle 4 (commit `e657a96c`) extended the `deploy-docker.sh` header docstring to enumerate every env var the script reads (including `AUTH_URL_OVERRIDE` and `DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE`).
- **Post-deploy Docker artifact pruning is on by default** (May 2026, commit `eac1f918`, scope hotfix in the same week; tightened 2026-06-30). `deploy-docker.sh` runs `prune_old_docker_artifacts()` on the app host and on every entry in `WORKER_HOSTS` at the end of each deploy: container prune, **dangling-only** `docker image prune -f` (NOT `-af`), builder prune, and BuildKit history metadata cleanup. It does **not** run `docker volume prune` anymore; detached volumes can contain recoverable PostgreSQL or uploaded user data, and `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` production policy forbids automated volume pruning. The first iteration used `image prune -af`, which wiped every `judge-*` language image on all three production targets because the worker spawns language containers transiently per submission instead of holding them open — the tagged-but-detached images looked "unused" to `-af`. Rationale for pruning at all: every `--no-cache` worker-image rebuild leaves the prior layer set dangling, so unpruned hosts hit disk-full and the next deploy thrashes (`auraedu` stalled at 95 % / 6.6 GB free in May 2026 before this landed). Set `SKIP_POST_DEPLOY_PRUNE=1` to opt out for a single deploy.
- **`DEPLOY_INSTANCE` log prefix** (cycle 5, closes C3-AGG-8). Optional human-readable host label (e.g. `auraedu`, `worker-0`) prepended to every `info`/`success`/`warn`/`error` log line as `[host=...]`. Lets parallel deploys to different targets remain disambiguable in shared log streams (e.g. side-by-side terminals during incident response). Behavior is identical to prior cycles when the env var is unset.
- **`npm run lint:bash`** (cycle 5, closes C3-AGG-4 / C2-AGG-4). Local syntax check (`bash -n deploy-docker.sh && bash -n deploy.sh`) catches heredoc / quoting regressions before they reach a deploy attempt. Recommended before any deploy-script edit. Future cycle may wire this into CI as a gate.
- **Pre-build disk guard + recurring host cleanup** (2026-06-19, tightened 2026-06-30 after worker-host gaps were found). `deploy-docker.sh` runs a Docker storage preflight after "Remote docker verified" and before every dedicated `WORKER_HOSTS` build. It checks `/`, Docker's `DockerRootDir`, and `/judge-workspaces` when present. If the highest-use mount is `>= DEPLOY_DISK_WARN_PCT` (default 85%) it reclaims **stopped containers + dangling images (`-f`, never `-af`) + build cache (`builder prune -af`) + the BuildKit history store (`docker buildx history rm --all`)** — NEVER volumes — then aborts with `die` if still `>= DEPLOY_DISK_HARD_PCT` (default 92%) rather than starting a doomed build. A host-level `systemd` timer (`/etc/systemd/system/docker-disk-cleanup.{service,timer}` → `/usr/local/bin/docker-disk-cleanup.sh`, runs every 6h) prunes the same artifacts independent of deploys, so even failed/aborted deploys get cleaned. **CRITICAL: neither path ever prunes volumes** (`docker volume prune` / `docker system prune --volumes` are absent by design — the PostgreSQL data volume lives there; this is the Apr 2026 data-loss class). The script uses `docker image prune -f` (dangling only) so it is safe on judge hosts too (tagged `judge-*` images are never wiped).
- **Dedicated worker URL reconciliation** (2026-06-30 cycle 2). Split-host deploys (`WORKER_HOSTS`) upsert `JUDGE_BASE_URL=<app AUTH_URL>/api/v1` into each worker host's `~/judgekit/.env` before restarting `docker-compose.worker.yml`. The deploy aborts when that URL would be non-local HTTP; production recovery must fix TLS / `AUTH_URL_OVERRIDE`, not set `JUDGE_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=1`. (The two prior split-host targets that exercised this — `algo` → `worker-0.algo.xylolabs.com` and `worv` → `worker.test.worv.ai` — have both since been retired.)
- **BuildKit history-corruption auto-recovery + sequential all-languages builds** (RPF cycle 2 of the 2026-06-11 loop, closes DEFERRED-OPS-1). **Failure signature:** any remote `docker build` / compose build aborting with `failed to solve: Internal: unknown blob sha256:... in history`. **Confirmed diagnosis** (auraedu, Docker 29.1.3 / buildx v0.20.0): the dangling reference lives in the BuildKit **history store**, not the build cache — `docker builder prune -af` does **NOT** clear it; `docker buildx history rm --all` **does** (metadata-only, zero downtime, leaves all images and cache layers intact). **Trigger:** one parallel bake solve of ~90 language targets on a cold cache (`docker compose build`) — two consecutive full-parallel runs corrupted fresh history stores. **What the script now does:** (a) the all-languages path (no `LANGUAGE_FILTER`) defaults to `LANGUAGE_BUILD_STRATEGY=sequential` — per-language `docker build` loop, the empirically clean path; `LANGUAGE_BUILD_STRATEGY=compose` opts back into the bake with `COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT` (default 4) capping concurrency; (b) every remote build goes through `run_remote_build()`, which detects the signature, runs `docker buildx history rm --all` on that host, and retries the failed step exactly once (loud warn lines; no other failure signatures trigger it). **Operator notes:** if recovery fails twice, see `docs/operator-incident-runbook.md` → "Scenario: deploy image-build failure"; never use `docker image prune -a` / `docker system prune -a` on worker hosts (deletes the ~80 tagged judge language images — see the pruning bullet above and `CLAUDE.md`).

Outstanding deferred deploy-script polish items are tracked in `plans/open/2026-04-29-rpf-cycle-5-review-remediation.md` (and prior cycle plans). They are LOW-severity defense-in-depth and observability improvements, all with concrete exit criteria.

## Build & Verify

```bash

```

## Testing Rules (MANDATORY)

Every feature, fix, or enhancement MUST include appropriate tests. **No code is considered complete without tests.** Work that lacks tests will be rejected.

### Test Layers (ALL required per feature)

Every new feature MUST have tests across all applicable layers:

| Layer | Tool | Location | Purpose | Required? |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Unit** | Vitest | `tests/unit/` | Pure functions, validators, utilities, scoring logic, data helpers | Always |
| **API / Mock** | Vitest | `tests/unit/api/` | Route handlers with mocked DB/auth, mock external deps | When API routes are added/changed |
| **Integration** | Vitest | `tests/integration/` | Cross-module interactions, real DB queries | When DB logic is complex |
| **E2E** | Playwright | `tests/e2e/` | Full user flows through the browser UI | Always for user-facing features |
| **Harness smoke** | Vitest (`vitest.config.harness.ts`) | `tests/harness/` | Compile+run each function-judging adapter's harness and assert byte-identical output to `serialization.ts` `encodeValue` | When a function-judging adapter (`src/lib/judge/function-judging/adapters/*`) or `serialization.ts` changes |

### Function-Judging Harness Smoke Layer

The adapter unit tests (`tests/unit/judge/function-judging/adapters/*.test.ts`)
only diff the GENERATED harness source against committed goldens — they never
compile or run it. That blind spot let two real bugs ship (the Java harness
never compiled due to a stray `\u` in a comment; C# mangled non-ASCII under the
POSIX locale). The harness smoke layer closes that gap by ACTUALLY compiling and
running every language's assembled harness and asserting its stdout is
byte-identical to the canonical `encodeValue`.

```bash
# Run the compile+run smoke layer (separate from the fast unit run).
npm run test:harness
```

- **When to run:** after any change to a function-judging adapter, the shared
  `serialization.ts`, or the adapter `types.ts`. It is intentionally kept out of
  `npm run test:unit` because it spawns real compilers (g++/clang++, javac, go,
  tsc) and a Docker container (Mono 6.12 for C#).
- **Toolchain-gated:** each language is skipped (never failed) when its
  toolchain is absent. To exercise a language locally you need its toolchain:
  `python3`, `node`, repo-local or global `tsc`, `go`, a C++23 `g++`/`clang++`
  (macOS Apple clang is fine — the runner injects a `bits/stdc++.h` shim), a
  JDK **>= 25** (`javac --release 25`; Homebrew `openjdk@25` is auto-detected),
  and for C# `docker` plus a locally cached `mono:6.12` image
  (`docker pull mono:6.12`). Languages whose toolchain is missing report SKIPPED
  with a clear reason.
- **CI:** wired into the `quality` job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) as a
  best-effort step; missing toolchains skip, so it cannot break CI.

### Per-Feature Test Checklist

For every feature, go through this checklist:

1. **Unit tests** — Test all pure logic (helpers, validators, scoring, data transforms) with known inputs/outputs. Mock DB and external dependencies. Cover both success and error paths.
2. **API / Mock tests** — Test route handlers with mocked auth and DB. Verify request validation, authorization checks, happy path responses, and error responses (401, 403, 404, 422).
3. **E2E tests** — Test the full user flow in a real browser. Navigate to the feature, interact with it, verify all sections render, verify navigation works. Test with both Korean and English locales where applicable.

### What to Test

- **New feature**: Unit tests for logic + API/mock tests for routes + E2E test for user flow (ALL three)
- **Bug fix**: Regression test that fails without the fix, passes with it
- **Refactor**: Existing tests must still pass; add tests if coverage gaps found
- **New language**: A+B solution in `tests/e2e/all-languages-judge.spec.ts` + Rust config test
- **New API route**: API test with auth/validation/happy-path/error cases + unit test for any helper functions
- **Validators**: Unit tests for valid/invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Scoring/contest logic**: Unit tests with known inputs and expected outputs
- **UI components**: E2E tests verifying rendering, interaction, and navigation

### Test Conventions

- Use factories from `tests/unit/support/factories.ts` for test data
- Mock external dependencies (DB, auth) in unit/API tests using `vi.mock()`
- E2E tests run against the test server (see `.env` for target), never production
- Name test files as `<module>.test.ts` (unit/API) or `<feature>.spec.ts` (E2E)
- Group related assertions in `describe` blocks
- Test both success and error paths
- Use `test.skip()` with clear reason for tests that depend on external state (e.g., "No contests available")

### E2E Testing Rules (MANDATORY)

**Target:** Always run E2E tests against the test server (see `.env` for host and credentials). Never against production.

```bash
# Standard E2E run (read .env for host, credentials)
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=<from .env> E2E_USERNAME=<from .env> E2E_PASSWORD='<from .env>' \
  npx playwright test tests/e2e/
```

**What to E2E test:**
- All user-facing features (contest, assignments, submissions, admin pages)
- All user roles (admin, instructor, student) with proper capabilities
- Contest modes: scheduled (start/end time) and windowed (fixed duration)
- All supported judge languages (`tests/e2e/all-languages-judge.spec.ts`)
- Participant audit: navigation, all sections render, back link
- Admin console: roles, users, settings, audit logs, languages (`/dashboard/admin/languages`)
- Student detail: per-student submission breakdown per assignment (`/dashboard/contests/[assignmentId]/students/[userId]`)
- Anti-cheat: event recording, filtering, similarity checks

**After every deploy:** Run full E2E suite against the test server to verify the deployment is healthy.

### Quality Gates (ALL must pass before deploy)

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero type errors
- `npx vitest run` — all unit tests pass
- `cargo test` (in judge-worker-rs/) — all Rust tests pass
- E2E tests pass against test server after deploy

## Environment Variables (`.env`)

All deployment credentials, SSH access, target hosts, and runtime secrets are documented in **`.env`** (gitignored, never committed). Before any deployment, SSH, or E2E testing task, **always read `.env` first** to get the correct values. See `.env.example` for the full list of available variables with placeholder values.

`.env` contains:
- **App runtime config** — auth secrets, database, rate limiting, judge worker settings
- **Deployment targets** — host IPs, domains, SSH users/passwords/keys, remote directories, app ports
- **Web admin credentials** — username/password for each environment
- **E2E test credentials** — `E2E_TEST_BASE_URL`, `E2E_TEST_USERNAME`, `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD`
- **SSH access commands** — ready-to-use `sshpass`/`ssh` commands for each target (in comments)
- **Docker & Nginx** — container management commands, nginx config paths (in comments)

**CRITICAL**: Always read `.env` for deployment targets, SSH credentials (hosts, users, passwords, keys), web admin logins, E2E test credentials, and remote directory paths. Never hardcode credentials in code or agent instructions. `.env` contains ready-to-use SSH commands, Docker Compose commands, and E2E test invocations for each target environment (in comments).

## Deployment

**RULE: Always read `.env` before any deployment, SSH, or E2E testing task.** Never guess credentials or host addresses — they are all documented in `.env`. Failing to read it first leads to failed deploys and wasted time. This includes reading deployment target variables (`TEST_HOST`, `TEST_SSH_USER`, `TEST_SSH_PASSWORD`, `TEST_DOMAIN`, `PROD_DOMAIN`, `PROD_SSH_USER`, `PROD_SSH_KEY`, etc.) and passing them correctly to the deploy script.

The primary deploy script is `deploy-docker.sh`. Pass environment variables from `.env`:
- `SSH_PASSWORD` — for password-based SSH auth (Target 1)
- `SSH_KEY` — for key-based SSH auth (Target 2)
- `REMOTE_HOST`, `REMOTE_USER`, `DOMAIN` — target overrides

Current deployment shortcut files use `~/.ssh/xylolabs-algo.pem` for
`oj.auraedu.me`. Keep this aligned with `docs/deployment.md` when rotating
keys. The former `worv` target (`test.worv.ai`, key
`~/.ssh/worv-judgekit.pem`) was retired from the deploy roster on 2026-07-06,
and the former `algo` target (`algo.xylolabs.com`) was retired on
2026-07-23; `deploy-docker.sh` rejects both `DEPLOY_TARGET=worv` and
`DEPLOY_TARGET=algo`, and the leftover local `.env.deploy.worv` / `.env.worv`
/ `.env.deploy.algo` files must not be used.

**Server-side builds:** `deploy-docker.sh` builds all Docker images directly on the remote server (not locally), avoiding architecture mismatches between dev machines and the target host. The script auto-detects the server's architecture (`amd64`/`arm64`) and sets the appropriate platform flag automatically.

**Docker Compose configuration (production):**
- The judge worker talks to the dedicated `docker-proxy` sidecar via `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-proxy:2375`
- `/judge-workspaces:/judge-workspaces` volume is mounted on the worker container for workspace sharing; `TMPDIR=/judge-workspaces` ensures the worker writes temp files there
- The host **must** have `/judge-workspaces` directory created before starting the stack

**Seccomp profile:** Uses a default-deny allow-list approach — default action is `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO`, with required runtime syscalls explicitly allowed and targeted compatibility blocks (for example `clone3`) returning errno.

Always test against the test server documented in `.env`, never against production. Read `.env` for all target hosts and domains.

## Select / Dropdown Components (CRITICAL)

This project uses `@base-ui/react/select` via `src/components/ui/select.tsx`. The `SelectValue` component has specific requirements:

### SelectValue MUST display the selected label via static children

`SelectValue` children must be a **simple expression** using the current **state variable** (not the value parameter). Turbopack cannot handle render functions or complex inline expressions as children. **Always** use this pattern:

```tsx
// Use the React state variable directly
<SelectValue placeholder="Select...">{labelMap[stateVar] || stateVar}</SelectValue>
```

### NEVER do these:
- `<SelectValue>{(value) => ...}</SelectValue>` — render functions crash Turbopack
- `<SelectValue />` alone — shows raw value (nanoid, key) instead of label
- Complex inline expressions with `??` or ternary chains — Turbopack parsing fails
- Custom children in `<SelectTrigger>` — breaks select behavior

### Every SelectItem MUST have a `label` prop:
```tsx
<SelectItem value="foo" label="Foo Label">Foo Label</SelectItem>
```

### Checklist when adding/modifying any Select:
1. SelectValue has **static children** using the React state variable: `{labelMap[stateVar] || stateVar}`
2. Every SelectItem has `label` prop matching its display text
3. Test: selected value shows readable label, not a raw ID/key
4. For "pick-to-add" selects (no persistent selection), use `key` prop to force remount after each pick
5. **NEVER** leave `<SelectValue />` without children — it shows the raw value (nanoid/key) instead of a label

## Internationalization (CRITICAL)

Two locales, `en` and `ko`, via next-intl. Every user-facing string lives in
`messages/en.json` **and** `messages/ko.json` — the two bundles must always hold
the same key set. Full guide: `docs/i18n.md`.

### A missing key renders the key path, not a fallback

next-intl returns the full key path as the string when a key is absent. It never
returns `undefined`, so a `??` guard is dead code and the user sees literal
`submissions.status.time_limit_exceeded` on the page.

### NEVER interpolate a runtime value into a message key

```tsx
// BROKEN — invisible to the literal-key test, and the DB value is not the key
label={t(`status.${submission.status}`) ?? submission.status}
```

Keys built from a template literal escape the literal-key scan in
`tests/unit/ui-i18n-keys-implementation.test.ts`, so this ships silently. Use one
of three guarded forms instead:

1. **A lookup map that owns the mapping** — `buildStatusLabels(t)` from
   `src/lib/judge/status-labels.ts` for submission verdicts. The DB stores
   `time_limit_exceeded` / `memory_limit_exceeded`; the bundles key those as
   `status.time_limit` / `status.memory_limit`. Build the map once per render,
   not per row.
2. **`translateApiErrorKey(t, code, fallbackKey)`** (`src/lib/i18n/api-error.ts`)
   — checks `t.has()` first, so an unknown API error code degrades to a real
   sentence.
3. **An explicit whitelist** `Set`/`switch` before the lookup. Every member of
   the whitelist MUST have a message — the whitelist is the contract.

### Server-action error codes are message keys

`src/lib/actions/*` return `{ success: false, error: "<code>" }` and callers do
`t(result.error ?? "...")`. A new code in `change-password.ts`, `public-signup.ts`,
`tag-management.ts`, `update-profile.ts`, or `user-management.ts` needs a matching
key in `changePassword` / `auth` / `admin.tags` / `profile` / `admin.users`.

### Checklist when adding any string or runtime-keyed lookup

1. Key added to **both** `en.json` and `ko.json`, same namespace, same position
2. No template literal in the `t()` argument — use a map, `t.has()`, or a whitelist
3. Korean copy matches the `~해요` voice already in `ko.json`, at default
   letter-spacing (see `CLAUDE.md` Typography)
4. New runtime-keyed lookup? Extend `tests/unit/ui-i18n-keys-implementation.test.ts`
   and document it in `docs/i18n.md`
5. `npx vitest run tests/unit/ui-i18n-keys-implementation.test.ts` passes

## Conventions

See `.context/development/conventions.md`.

## Password Validation (MANDATORY)

Password validation MUST only check minimum length — **exactly 8 characters minimum**, no other rules. Do NOT add complexity requirements (uppercase, numbers, symbols), similarity checks, or dictionary checks.

- Server-side: `src/lib/security/password.ts` — `FIXED_MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 8`, only checks `password.length < 8`
- Client-side: any form accepting a password MUST validate `length >= 8` before submission and show a clear error message
- Do NOT change the minimum from 8 without explicit approval
