## Features

- **Cross-platform (AMD64 + ARM64)** — Full stack runs natively on both architectures: Next.js app, Rust judge worker, Rust sidecars, and all 69 Docker judge images. Deploy on x86-64 servers or ARM64 (AWS Graviton, Ampere Altra, Apple Silicon) with automatic architecture detection — no emulation, no cross-compilation
- **86 languages** — C/C++, Java, Python, Rust, Go, Assembly (NASM), Objective-C, Haxe, Raku, Odin, and [76 more](docs/languages.md), all with multi-arch Docker images and admin-customizable compile/run settings
- **Secure execution** — Docker containers with no network, seccomp, memory/CPU limits
- **Role-based access** — Super admin, admin, instructor, student
- **Classroom management** — Groups, enrollments, assignments with deadlines and late penalties
- **Contest system** — IOI and ICPC scoring, scheduled and windowed modes, real-time leaderboard, anti-cheat
- **Code similarity** — Rust-accelerated Jaccard n-gram analysis with TS fallback

## Getting Started

### Quickstart for Agents

Paste the following prompt into [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), [Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), or any AI coding agent:

```text
Clone and set up JudgeKit (online judge platform) for local development.

1. git clone https://github.com/hletrd/JudgeKit.git && cd JudgeKit
2. Run `bash scripts/setup.sh` (or `bash scripts/setup.sh --defaults` for non-interactive)
3. Run `npm run dev` to start on http://localhost:3000
4. Log in with admin / admin123

Do NOT build Docker judge images — they are only needed for submission judging, not for running the web app.
```

### Manual setup

<details>
<summary>Step-by-step instructions</summary>

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # Set AUTH_SECRET (openssl rand -base64 32)
npm run db:push
npm run seed                 # Creates admin/admin123
npm run dev
```

Optionally build judge Docker images:

```bash
docker build -t judge-python -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-python .
```

See [Language presets](docs/languages.md#docker-image-presets) for preset options (`core`, `popular`, `extended`, `all`).

## Deployment Prerequisites

- **Docker socket**: Both the `app` and `judge-worker` containers require `/var/run/docker.sock` mounted. The app container uses it for admin image management (build/remove language images via `/dashboard/admin/languages`). The judge worker uses it for sandboxed code execution.
- **`/judge-workspaces`**: Must exist on the host before starting the stack — used as the shared workspace volume between the judge worker and sibling judge containers.
- The `deploy-docker.sh` script handles setup automatically (server-side builds, architecture detection, nginx config). See [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md).

## Documentation

- [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md) — provisioning, deploy scripts, nginx, post-deploy checks
- [Authentication](docs/authentication.md) — sign-in flow, cookie architecture, API smoke test
- [Languages](docs/languages.md) — all 86 variants, Docker image presets, admin management
