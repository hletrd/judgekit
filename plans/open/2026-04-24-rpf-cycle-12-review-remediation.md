# RPF Cycle 12 (Loop 12/100) — Review Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Cycle:** 12/100 (current RPF loop)
**Base commit:** d13c700b (cycle 11 — CR11-1 fix)
**HEAD commit:** d13c700b

## Findings to Address

This cycle found **2 new findings** across 10 review agents. Both are MEDIUM severity with HIGH confidence and represent real correctness/security risks.

## Scheduled Implementation Tasks

### TASK-1: Strengthen `isEncryptedPluginSecret` to validate full structure, not just prefix [MEDIUM]

**Source:** CR12-1 (flagged by 7 agents: code-reviewer, security-reviewer, critic, debugger, verifier, tracer, test-engineer)
**File:** `src/lib/plugins/secrets.ts:10-12, 132-136`
**Severity:** MEDIUM / Confidence: HIGH

**Current behavior:** `isEncryptedPluginSecret()` only checks for the `enc:v1:` prefix. After the CR11-1 fix, `preparePluginConfigForStorage` trusts this function as the gatekeeper for the "already encrypted" path. A malformed value like `enc:v1:garbage` passes the check, is stored as-is, and fails on read — causing the plugin secret to silently fall back to empty string.

**Expected behavior:** `isEncryptedPluginSecret()` should validate that the value has the full `enc:v1:base64url:base64url:base64url` structure. Malformed `enc:v1:` values should be treated as non-encrypted (i.e., they should be encrypted before storage).

**Implementation:**
1. Add a new `isValidEncryptedPluginSecret()` function in `secrets.ts` that validates:
   - Starts with `enc:v1:`
   - Has exactly 5 colon-separated parts: `enc:v1:iv:tag:ciphertext`
   - Each of `iv`, `tag`, `ciphertext` is a non-empty string
2. Update `preparePluginConfigForStorage` to use `isValidEncryptedPluginSecret()` instead of `isEncryptedPluginSecret()`
3. Keep `isEncryptedPluginSecret()` as-is for the decryption path (it's used in `decryptPluginSecret` to decide whether to attempt decryption — a malformed value should still reach the decryption path so the error is properly handled)
4. Add JSDoc to both functions explaining the difference

**Code change in `src/lib/plugins/secrets.ts`:**

```typescript
// After isEncryptedPluginSecret (keep as-is for decrypt path):
export function isEncryptedPluginSecret(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === "string" && value.startsWith(`${ENCRYPTION_VERSION}:`);
}

// New function for storage gating:
export function isValidEncryptedPluginSecret(value: string): boolean {
  if (!isEncryptedPluginSecret(value)) return false;
  const parts = value.split(":");
  // enc:v1:iv:tag:ciphertext — exactly 5 parts, each non-empty
  if (parts.length !== 5) return false;
  return parts.slice(2).every((part) => part.length > 0);
}
```

In `preparePluginConfigForStorage`, change line 132:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
if (isEncryptedPluginSecret(incomingValue)) {

// AFTER:
if (isValidEncryptedPluginSecret(incomingValue)) {
```

### TASK-2: Add strict mode to `decrypt()` — reject plaintext values in production [MEDIUM]

**Source:** CR12-2 (flagged by 3 agents: code-reviewer, security-reviewer, critic)
**File:** `src/lib/security/encryption.ts:79-88`
**Severity:** MEDIUM / Confidence: HIGH

**Current behavior:** `decrypt()` silently returns plaintext when the value doesn't start with `enc:`. In production, only a `logger.warn` is emitted. This creates a silent bypass path for encrypted data.

**Expected behavior:** In production, `decrypt()` should throw when encountering a non-encrypted value, unless explicitly opted out. This prevents silent encryption bypass if an attacker manages to write plaintext to an encrypted column.

**Implementation:**
1. Add an `allowPlaintextFallback` option to `decrypt()` (default: `false` in production, `true` for backward compatibility during migration)
2. When `allowPlaintextFallback` is `false` (default in production) and the value doesn't start with `enc:`, throw an error instead of returning plaintext
3. Update existing callers that rely on the plaintext fallback to explicitly pass `allowPlaintextFallback: true` during the migration period
4. Add JSDoc documenting the migration path

**Code change in `src/lib/security/encryption.ts`:**

```typescript
export function decrypt(encoded: string, options?: { allowPlaintextFallback?: boolean }): string {
  const allowPlaintext = options?.allowPlaintextFallback ??
    (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production");

  if (!encoded.startsWith("enc:")) {
    if (!allowPlaintext) {
      throw new Error(
        "decrypt() called on non-encrypted value. " +
        "If this is expected during migration, pass allowPlaintextFallback: true. " +
        "Otherwise, investigate possible data tampering or incomplete migration."
      );
    }
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
      logger.warn(
        { prefix: encoded.slice(0, 10) },
        "[encryption] decrypt() called on non-encrypted value — possible data tampering or incomplete migration"
      );
    }
    return encoded;
  }
  // ... rest unchanged
}
```

Then update callers that need the fallback:
- `src/lib/security/hcaptcha.ts:23` — `decrypt(hcaptchaSecret)` → `decrypt(hcaptchaSecret, { allowPlaintextFallback: true })` (system settings may not yet be migrated)
- Any other callers that read from the `system_settings` table where values may not yet be encrypted

## Deferred Items (carried from cycle 4 + cycle 12 additions)

All deferred-fix rules obeyed: file+line citation, original severity/confidence preserved (no downgrade), concrete reason, and exit criterion recorded. No security, correctness, or data-loss findings are in the deferred list — all are performance/UX/cosmetic/doc items explicitly allowed under `CLAUDE.md` and `.context/development/conventions.md`.
