# Archived plans

This folder keeps **completed or historical planning artifacts**.

## Contents
- Copies of finished `.omx/plans/*.md` artifacts for reference
- archived implementation plans whose associated review backlogs were fully burned down
- review-status notes explaining why certain review files are implemented or superseded rather than reopened

## Why copied instead of moved
`.omx/plans/` is part of the OMX runtime/state surface. These files were copied here so the repo has a stable, user-facing archive without mutating runtime history.

## Note on the current planning pass
The historical current-head remediation plans listed above remain archived because their associated work was already completed or explicitly closed in earlier passes. The 2026-04-19 current-head follow-up lane also moved here once `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx vitest run` were restored to green. The fresh actionable backlog now lives primarily under `.context/plans/`.
