## Superseded review lines

### `.context/reviews/comprehensive-code-review-2026-04-07.md`
- **Status:** archived as superseded
- **Reason:** later 2026-04-09 / 2026-04-10 reviews revisit the same surfaces with fresher evidence and were themselves planned/executed.

### `.context/reviews/comprehensive-code-review-2026-04-09-worktree.md`
- **Status:** archived as implemented/superseded
- **Reason:** its concrete findings already map to completed remediation work and no fresh open plan is needed.

### `.context/reviews/comprehensive-security-review-2026-04-09.md`
- **Status:** archived as superseded
- **Reason:** the 2026-04-10 security review is the fresher authoritative security artifact and already includes closure evidence.

### `.context/reviews/_archive/*`
- **Status:** historical review context only
- **Reason:** retained for reference, not for new implementation planning.

## Open review lines after this pass
Only the following review artifacts still require fresh planning after comparing the full current set against archived plan evidence:
- `.context/reviews/multi-perspective-review-2026-04-12.md`

Their actionable planning artifacts now live under `plans/open/`.
