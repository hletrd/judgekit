 * `{ from, to }` window that LACK an AI comment (dedup predicate: no
 * `submission_comments` row with `authorId IS NULL`), scoped to the reviewer's
 * groups like bulk-rejudge, and restricted to problems with `allowAiAssistant`
 * on — the generator always refuses the rest, so counting them would make
 * `remaining` un-drainable and wedge the oldest-first batch.
 *
 * Not gated by the `autoCodeReviewEnabled` toggle — this is an explicit admin
 * action. Resumable + bounded: counts total matching (`remaining`) and enqueues
 * up to BACKFILL_BATCH of the oldest matches through the shared review queue
 * (fire-and-forget, respecting the pLimit(2) + queue-cap guards). Because
 * generation is dedup-safe, repeated calls drain the rest.
