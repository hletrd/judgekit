## Docker Image Presets

| Preset | Languages | Est. Size |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `core` | C/C++, Python, Java/Kotlin | ~0.8 GB |
| `popular` | Core + Node.js, Rust, Go | ~2.5 GB |
| `extended` | Popular + Ruby, Lua, Bash, C#, PHP, Perl, Swift, R, Haskell, Dart, Zig | ~8 GB |
| `all` | All 72 images | ~30 GB |

## Admin Language Management

`/dashboard/admin/languages` lets admins override per-language settings at runtime:
- Docker image name, compile command, run command
- Enable/disable toggle
- Build and remove Docker images from the UI

Changes take effect immediately for new submissions without restarting services.
